# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,

Please note we have a [CODE OF CONDUCT](/docs/Code_of_Conduct.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Overview

This project aims to offer simple utilities for API development on AWS Lambda. Some of these utilities may work for other frameworks like Express, however this is just a happy coincidence. 

### Non Goals

This product does not aim to offer everything needed for RESTful development on AWS Lambda, just a jump-start. We are getting the low hanging fruit to speed up development, nothing more.

## Technology and Code

This is an npm package so it's Typescript/Javascript.

Please see [Best Practices](/docs/Best_Practices.md) for Typescript coding standards.

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure you thoroughly fill out the pull request form presented when submitting the request.

   have been added, how to perform other tests or run the code, and other potentially relevant
   notes. 
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the application, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and/or container parameters.
3. If you are on the project team you may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
